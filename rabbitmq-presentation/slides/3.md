### The Why: Reactive Manifesto

---

#### Responsive.

- React to users needs quickly and predictably

#### Resilient.

- React to failure and ensure they don't effect other parts of the system

#### Elastic.

- React to load, and scale accordingly
- RMQ's system reacts to changes in input rate for the user

#### Message Driven.

- Interaction between services/servers/apps with messages asynchronously
- Loosely coupled, isolated components are established by messages
- Load mgmt, elasticity, flow control
